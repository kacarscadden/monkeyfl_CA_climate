# monkeyfl_CA_climate

This repo contains scripts for the climate portion of a study on monkeyflower environmental tolerances. In brief, there are multiple populations of each of seven monkeyflower species, from across California. These scripts:

- 01 & 02:  obtain climate rasters, extract climate data at the population localities,
- 03: summarize the monthly climate data, generate climate PCA axes, and outline convex hulls (polygons) of each population and species in climate space
- 04: explore estimates of climate breadth (polygon areas) and position (polygon centroids), and calculate overlap of polygons in climate space (i.e., climatic niche similarity among populations)
